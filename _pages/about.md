I'm a computer science student at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine, Trinidad. I have a passion for Machine Learning, AI, Robotics and other related fields including IoT.

I hope to use this blog to document my journey as a computer science student to show my growth, help others and for personal reflection.

My other hobbies/interests include sports, mainly Football(Soccer), Table Tennis, Volleyball. Even with these 3 sport I play as many sports as I can get my hands on like Tennis, Basketball, Cricket. Even chess which I know is controversial to call a sport lol.

I'm listing all these sports to explain the fact that I'm a really competitive person which I think to be a good thing =D. I like to take on any sort of challenge and usually turn it into some sort of competition or attempt to get as good a "score" as I can.

This also ties in with my love for video games and e-sports. I play a lot of competitive games when I'm not enjoying the story of a beautiful single player game or having fun with friends on a crazy multiplayer game.
