Hello everyone. Seeing that this is my first blog post, I hope to be very free with my writing and just create something enjoyable for you to read. Enjoy.

# About the Project
This project is mainly being done for my 'Software Engineering 2' course at my university, The University of the West Indies (UWI). There were not many restrictions in what we could work on but the biggest focus of the project was for us to adhere to the SCRUM methodology of software development.

The project my group decided on was to create a software that could recognize cars in a car park, specifically a carpark from my university and recognize how many parking spots were taken up. Then to take the information gathered and present this in a public medium like a web app, to students of UWI.

Quite a bit has happened since the beginning of this project but I sadly didn't have it all well documented under dates so under this post, I'll cover everything notable that's happened for me.

### Software Development Process
So the main requirement of this project is to follow the SCRUM agile development model. Without going into specific terminology, it seems to be one or the more informal models, or rather, more interactive models.

Of all the models I've studied for this course, I think SCRUM is definitely my favourite because it doesn't feel as strict. It may be because I'm just doing this with a couple of friends, but I also like the idea of the regular quick meetings, being able to get together and discuss progress and even share ideas.

To get the requirements, one person had to act as the 'Product Manager' and list requirements but honestly, everyone in the group listed requirements just so we could get the best out of the system. To be fair though, the product manager started it off.

This is the result of developing our product and sprint backlog:
