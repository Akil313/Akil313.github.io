Hello everyone. Seeing that this is my first blog post, I hope to be very free with my writing and just create something enjoyable for you to read. Enjoy.

# About the Project
This project is mainly being done for my 'Software Engineering 2' course at my university, The University of the West Indies (UWI). There were not many restrictions in what we could work on but the biggest focus of the project was for us to adhere to the SCRUM methodology of software development.

The project my group decided on was to create a software that could recognize cars in a car park, specifically a carpark from my university and recognize how many parking spots were taken up. Then to take the information gathered and present this in a public medium like a web app, to students of UWI.
